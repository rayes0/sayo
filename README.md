# sayo

sayo is a warm-toned, low contrast colorscheme designed for reading and study. The goal of sayo is to be a desaturated colorscheme with a warm brown feel, allowing comfortable reading for long periods of time.

While being primarily designed for prose, sayo is also suitable for code as well.
